		<h1>Summer Best! </h1>
		<h2>In my opinion</h2>
		<p>
		Summer better than winter. The reason why I love summer because in summer we can wear light clothes, enjoy the beach. And last reason is we are in Canada.

		First of all, we can wear light clothes in summer. I donâ€™t like wear too much clothes, it will make me feel heavy. And I am tattoo lover, I would like to share my tattoo with people who love tattoo also.
		</p>

		<p>
		Second, I like the beach and the sea. I am really enjoy the summer time have fun with friends. And I love diving.
		</p>

		<p>
		In the end, I love summer because I am in Canada.  There almost six months of the year in winter with low temperatures. So I cherish summer very much.
